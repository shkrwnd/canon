Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Cursor for Living Documents

1. Product Overview
Problem Statement:
Current AI tools operate in a stateless or append-only manner. Users who work iteratively—writers, editors, founders, researchers, and power ChatGPT users—must repeatedly re-explain context, manually merge AI outputs, and manage multiple conflicting versions. There is no system that maintains a single evolving, authoritative document based on user intent.
Product Vision:
Build an agentic editor that maintains living documents. Users express intent in natural language; the system decides what to edit, when to edit, and when to search the web—similar to Cursor, but for non-code content.
What This Product Is:
- An intent-driven editorial workspace
- A Markdown-first living document system
- An agent that maintains correctness over time
What This Product Is Not:
- A traditional text editor (Google Docs, Word)
- A note-taking app
- A chatbot with memory
- A task manager
2. Target Users
Primary Users:
- Writers and screenwriters
- Newspaper and magazine editors
- ChatGPT power users
Secondary Users:
- Founders
- Researchers and students
- Knowledge workers with ADHD-style workflows
3. Core Concept: Modules
A module is a named, persistent, authoritative unit of state.
Each module contains:
- Name
- Standing instruction
- Current canonical state (Markdown)
The agent always rewrites the full state—never appends.
4. Agent Behavior
Single-agent system in v1.
Agent Responsibilities:
- Detect intent
- Resolve target module
- Decide whether to edit
- Decide whether web search is required
- Rewrite entire module state
- Persist canonical truth
5. Manual Editing
- Read-only by default
- Explicit edit mode
- Raw Markdown editing
- Manual edits always override agent output
6. Web Search Integration
The agent performs web search only when necessary:
- Safety-critical domains
- New tools/products
- Factual verification
- “Latest” or “current” requests
Search results are used internally to ensure correctness.
7. User Interface
Three-pane layout:
- Left: Module list
- Center: Rendered Markdown (authoritative state)
- Right: Chat / command history
The document is truth.
Chat is intent.
8. Markdown Model
- Markdown is the source of truth
- Rendered view by default
- Raw Markdown editor in edit mode
- No WYSIWYG abstraction
9. UX Principles
- Agent is default editor
- User is override
- Silence over suggestions
- No background updates
- No version history
10. Non-Goals (v1)
- Collaboration
- Track changes
- Diffs and history
- Background agents
- Rich formatting
- Vector databases
11. Tech Stack
Backend:
- FastAPI
- SQLite
- OpenAI GPT-4o
- Tavily
Frontend:
- React + Vite
- shadcn/ui
- Tailwind
- CodeMirror (Markdown)
12. Success Metric
Primary success signal:
“I stopped maintaining this manually.”
13. Positioning Statement
This is not a text editor.
It is an AI editor that maintains living documents.
